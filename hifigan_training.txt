GLaDOS_00_part1_entry-1|hello and again welcome to the aperture science computeraided enrichment center
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry-2|we hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry-3|your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry-4|before we start however keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of all enrichment center activities serious injuries may occur
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry-7|stand back the portal will open in three two one
GLaDOS_00_part1_success-1|excellent please proceed into the chamberlock after completing each test
GLaDOS_00_part1_success-2|first however note the incandescent particle field across the exit
GLaDOS_00_part1_success-3|this aperture science material emancipation grill will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it  for instance the aperture science weighted storage cube
GLaDOS_generic_crate_vaporized_in_emancipation_grid-1|please do not attempt to remove testing apparatus from the testing area
GLaDOS_generic_crate_vaporized_in_emancipation_grid-2|a replacement aperture science weighted storage cube will be delivered shortly
GLaDOS_00_part2_entry-1|please place the weighted storage cube on the fifteen hundred megawatt aperture science heavy duty supercolliding super button
GLaDOS_00_part2_success-1|perfect please move quickly to the chamberlock as the effects of prolonged exposure to the button are not part of this test
GLaDOS_01_part1_entry-1|youre doing very well
GLaDOS_01_part1_entry-2|please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the aperture science material emancipation grill which may in semi rare cases emancipate dental fillings crowns tooth enamel and teeth
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun-1|very good you are now in possession of the aperture science handheld portal device
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun-2|with it you can create your own portals
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun-3|these intra dimensional gates have proven to be completely safe
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun-4|the device however has not
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun-5|do not touch the operational end of the device
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun-6|do not look directly at the operational end of the device
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun-7|do not submerge the device in liquid even partially
GLaDOS_01_part2_entry-1|please proceed to the chamberlock mind the gap
GLaDOS_01_part2_success-1|well done remember the aperture science bring your daughter to work day is the perfect time to have her tested
GLaDOS_02_part1_entry-1|welcome to test chamber four
GLaDOS_02_part1_entry-2|youre doing quite well
GLaDOS_02_part1_success-1|once again excellent work
GLaDOS_02_part1_success-2|as part of a required test protocol we will not monitor the next test chamber you will be entirely on your own good luck
GLaDOS_02_part2_success-1|as part of a required test protocol our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication
GLaDOS_03_part1_entry-1|while safety is one of many enrichment center goals the aperture science high energy pellet seen to the left of the chamber can and has caused permanent disabilities such as vaporization
GLaDOS_03_part1_entry-2|please be careful
GLaDOS_03_part2_entry-1|warning devices are required on all mobile equipment however alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high energy pellet and have therefore been disabled for your safety
GLaDOS_03_part2_platform_activated-1|good now use the aperture science unstationary scaffold to reach the chamberlock
GLaDOS_04_part1_entry-1|please note that we have added a consequence for failure any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record followed by death good luck
GLaDOS_04_part1_success-1|very impressive please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience
GLaDOS_05_part1_entry-1|the enrichment center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible
GLaDOS_05_part1_entry-2|make no attempt to solve it
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag1-1|the enrichment center apologizes for this clearly broken test chamber
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag2-1|once again the enrichment center offers its most sincere apologies on the occasion of this unsolvable test environment
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag3-1|frankly this chamber was a mistake if we were you we would quit now
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag4-1|no one will blame you for giving up in fact quitting at this point is a perfectly reasonable response
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag5-1|quit now and cake will be served immediately
GLaDOS_05_part1_success-1|fantastic you remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism
GLaDOS_06_part1_success_1-1|spectacular you appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum or to be more precise how it does not
GLaDOS_06_part1_success_2-1|momentum a function of mass and velocity is conserved between portals in laymans terms speedy thing goes in speedy thing comes out
GLaDOS_07_part1_entry-1|the enrichment center promises to always provide a safe testing environment
GLaDOS_07_part1_entry-2|in dangerous testing environments the enrichment center promises to always provide useful advice
GLaDOS_07_part1_entry-3|for instance the floor here will kill you  try to avoid it
GLaDOS_07_part1_trapped-1|through no fault of the enrichment center you have managed to trap yourself in this room
GLaDOS_07_part1_trapped-2|an escape hatch will open in three two one
GLaDOS_07_part1_get_device_component-1|the device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once
GLaDOS_07_part1_get_device_component-2|as part of an optional test protocol we are pleased to present an amusing fact
GLaDOS_08_part1_entry-1|now that you are in control of both portals this next test could take a very very long time
GLaDOS_08_part1_entry-2|if you become lightheaded from thirst feel free to pass out
GLaDOS_08_part1_entry-3|an intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline
GLaDOS_08_part1_success-1|as part of a previously mentioned required test protocol we can no longer lie to you
GLaDOS_08_part1_success-2|when the testing is over you will be missed
GLaDOS_09_part1_entry-1|all subjects intending to handle highenergy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they may be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues
GLaDOS_09_part1_entry-2|no further compliance information is required or will be provided and you are an excellent test subject
GLaDOS_09_part1_success-1|very very good a complimentary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber
GLaDOS_08_part1_trapped-1|despite the best efforts of the enrichment center staff to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities you have managed to ensnare yourself permanently inside this room
GLaDOS_08_part1_trapped-2|a complimentary escape hatch will open in three two one
GLaDOS_10_part1_entry-1|the enrichment center is committed to the well being of all participants
GLaDOS_10_part1_entry-2|cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test
GLaDOS_10_part1_entry-3|thank you for helping us help you help us all
GLaDOS_10_part1_success-1|did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the aperture science self esteem fund for girls its true
GLaDOS_11_part1_entry-1|due to mandatory scheduled maintenance the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable
GLaDOS_11_part1_entry-2|it has been replaced with a livefire course designed for military androids
GLaDOS_11_part1_entry-3|the enrichment center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck
GLaDOS_11_part1_success-1|well done android the enrichment center once again reminds you that android hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance
GLaDOS_13_part1_entry-1|the vital apparatus vent will deliver a weighted companion cube in three two one
GLaDOS_13_part1_pickup-1|this weighted companion cube will accompany you through the test chamber please take care of it
GLaDOS_13_part1_middle-1|the symptoms most commonly produced by enrichment center testing are superstition perceiving inanimate objects as alive and hallucinations
GLaDOS_13_part1_middle-2|the enrichment center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and in fact cannot speak
GLaDOS_13_part1_middle-2b-1|the enrichment center reminds you that the weighted companion cube cannot speak
GLaDOS_13_part1_middle-2b-2|in the event that the weighted companion cube does speak the enrichment center urges you to disregard its advice
GLaDOS_13_part1_end-1|you did it the weighted companion cube certainly brought you good luck
GLaDOS_13_part1_end-2|however it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and unfortunately must be euthanized
GLaDOS_13_part1_end-3|please escort your companion cube to the aperture science emergency intelligence incinerator
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag-1|rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the enrichment center aperture science employees and all test subjects of any moral responsibility for the companion cube euthanizing process
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag-2|while it has been a faithful companion your companion cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test if it could talk  and the enrichment center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot  it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag-3|testing cannot continue until your companion cube has been incinerated
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag-4|although the euthanizing process is remarkably painful eight out of ten aperture science engineers believe that the companion cube is most likely incapable of feeling much pain
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag-5|the companion cube cannot continue through the testing state and local statutory regulations prohibit it from simply remaining here alone and companionless you must euthanize it
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag-6|destroy your companion cube or the testing cannot continue
GLaDOS_13_part1_euthanized-1|you euthanized your faithful companion cube more quickly than any test subject on record congratulations
GLaDOS_14_part1_entry-1|the experiment is nearing its conclusion
GLaDOS_14_part1_entry-2|the enrichment center is required to remind you that you will be baked and then there will be cake
GLaDOS_generic_crate_lost-1|weighted storage cube destroyed
GLaDOS_generic_crate_lost-2|please proceed to the aperture science vital apparatus vent for a replacement
GLaDOS_14_part1_end-1|well done be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions
GLaDOS_14_part1_end-2|for more information please attend an enrichment center electrical safety seminar
GLaDOS_15_part1_entry-1|welcome to the final test
GLaDOS_15_part1_entry-2|when you are done you will drop the device in the equipment recovery annex
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire-1|congratulations the test is now over
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire-2|all aperture technologies remain safely operational up to four thousand degrees kelvin
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire-3|rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire-4|thank you for participating in this aperture science computeraided enrichment activity
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire-5|goodbye
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech-1|what are you doing stop it i i we are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech-2|we are very very happy for your success
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech-3|we are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech-4|place the device on the ground then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech-5|a party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech-6|make no further attempt to leave the testing area
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech-7|assume the party escort submission position or you will miss the party
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed-2|to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities do not destroy vital testing apparatus
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed-3|for your own safety do not destroy vital testing apparatus
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed-4|certain objects may be vital to your success do not destroy testing apparatus
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed-5|vital testing apparatus destroyed
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed-1|at the enrichment center we promise never to value your safety above your unique ideas and creativity however do not destroy vital testing apparatus
GLaDOS_chellgladoswakeup01|oh its you
GLaDOS_chellgladoswakeup04|its been a long time how have you been
GLaDOS_chellgladoswakeup05|ive been really busy being dead you know after you murdered me
GLaDOS_chellgladoswakeup06|okay look we both said a lot of things that youre going to regret but i think we can put our differences behind us for science you monster
GLaDOS_wakeup_outro01|i will say though that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up you must really really love to test
GLaDOS_wakeup_outro02|i love it too theres just one small thing we need to take care of first
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_01|here we are the incinerator room be careful not to trip over any parts of me that didnt get completely burned when you threw them down here
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_18|the dual portal device should be around here somewhere once you find it we can start testing just like old times
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_03|there it is
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_04|hold on
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_05|there
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found01|good you have a dual portal device there should be a way back to the testing area up ahead
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_08|once testing starts im required by protocol to keep interaction with you to a minimum luckily we havent started testing yet this will be our only chance to talk
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_12|here let me get that for you
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_09|do you know the biggest lesson i learned from what you did i discovered i have a sort of blackbox quicksave feature in the event of a catastrophic failure the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_10|i was able  well forced really  to relive you killing me again and again forever
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found05|you know if youd done that to somebody else they might devote their existences to exacting revenge
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found06|luckily im a bigger person than that im happy to put this all behind us and get back to work after all weve got a lot to do and only sixty more years to do it more or less i dont have the actuarial tables in front of me
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_13|ill just move that out of the way for you this place really is a wreck
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found07|but the important thing is youre back with me and now im onto all your little tricks so theres nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found08|after thatwho knows i might take up a hobby reanimating the dead maybe
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry01|sorry about the mess ive really let the place go since you killed me by the way thanks for that
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry02|oh good thats back online ill start getting everything else working while you perform this first simple test
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry03|which involves deadly lasers and how test subjects react when locked in a room with deadly lasers
GLaDOS_sp_a2_laser_intro_ending02|not bad i forgot how good you are at this you should pace yourself though we have a lot of tests to do
GLaDOS_sp_a2_laser_stairs_intro02|this next test involves discouragement redirection cubes id just finished building them before you had your well episode so now well both get to see how they work
GLaDOS_sp_a2_laser_stairs_intro03|there should be one in the corner
GLaDOS_sp_laser_powered_lift_completion02|well done here come the test results you are a horrible person im serious thats what it says a horrible person we werent even testing for that
GLaDOS_sp_a2_dual_lasers_intro01|dont let that horrible person thing discourage you its just a data point if it makes you feel any better science has now validated your birth mothers decision to abandon you on a doorstep
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_completion01|congratulations not on the test
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_completion03|most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished i want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds
GLaDOS_sp_laser_over_goo_entry01|one moment
GLaDOS_sp_a2_laser_over_goo_intro01|youre navigating these test chambers faster than i can build them so feel free to slow down and do whatever it is you do when youre not destroying this facility
GLaDOS_sp_laser_over_goo_completion01|ill give you credit i guess you are listening to me but for the record you dont have to go that slowly
GLaDOS_testchambermisc12|waddle over to the elevator and well continue the testing
GLaDOS_faith_plate_intro01|this next test involves the aperture science aerial faith plate it was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space results were highly informative they could not good luck
GLaDOS_sp_a2_catapult01|heres an interesting fact youre not breathing real air its too expensive to pump this far down we just take carbon dioxide out of a room freshen it up a little and pump it back in so youll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life i thought that was interesting
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_intro_completion01|lets see what the next test is oh advanced aerial faith plates
GLaDOS_sp_trust_fling_entry01|well have fun soaring through the air without a care in the world
GLaDOS_sp_trust_fling_entry02|i have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up fifteen acres of broken glass by myself
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling01|oh sorry im still cleaning out the test chambers
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling02|so sometimes theres still trash in them standing around smelling and being useless
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling03|try to avoid the garbage hurtling towards you
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling04|you dont have to test with the garbage its garbage
GLaDOS_faithplategarbage06|press the button again
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling06|remember before when i was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless that was a metaphor i was actually talking about you and im sorry you didnt react at the time so i was worried it sailed right over your head which would have made this apology seem insane thats why i had to call you garbage a second time just now
GLaDOS_sp_paint_jump_wall_jumps02|im sorry i dont know why that went off anyway just an interesting science fact
GLaDOS_fizzlecube01|oh did i accidentally fizzle that before you could complete the test im sorry
GLaDOS_fizzlecube03|go ahead and grab another one
GLaDOS_fizzlecube05|oh no i fizzled that one too
GLaDOS_fizzlecube06|oh well we have warehouses full of the things absolutely worthless im happy to get rid of them
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings03|every test chamber is equipped with an emancipation grill at its exit so that test subjects cant smuggle test objects out of the test area this one is broken
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings02|dont take anything with you
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings_future_starter01|uh oh youre stranded lets see if the cube will try to help you escape actually so that were not here all day ill just cut to the chase it wont any feelings you think it has for you are simply byproducts of your sad empty life
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings_future_starter02|anyway heres a new cube for you to project your deranged loneliness onto
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings06|i think that one was about to say i love you they are sentient of course we just have a lot of them
GLaDOS_sp_a2_fizzler_intro01|this next test involves emancipation grills remember i told you about them in the last test area that did not have one
GLaDOS_sp_a2_fizzler_intro04|ohhh no the turbines again  i have to go  wait this next test does require some explanation let me give you the fast version
GLaDOS_sp_a2_fizzler_intro06|there if you have any questions just remember what i said in slow motion test on your own recognizance ill be right back
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone01|well im back the aerial faith plate in here is sending a distress signal
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone02|you broke it didnt you
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone03|there try it now
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failuretwo01|hmm this plate must not be calibrated to someone of your generous ness ill add a few zeros to the maximum weight
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failuretwo02|you look great by the way very healthy
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failuretwo03|try it now
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failurethree01|you seem to have defeated its loadbearing capacity well done ill just lower the ceiling
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_completion01|look at you sailing through the air majestically like an eagle piloting a blimp
GLaDOS_sp_a2_ricochet01|enjoy this next test im going to go to the surface its a beautiful day out yesterday i saw a deer if you solve this next test maybe ill let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room and ill tell you about the time i saw a deer again
GLaDOS_testchambermisc27|well you passed the test i didnt see the deer today i did see some humans but with you here ive got more test subjects than ill ever need
GLaDOS_sp_a2_future_starter01|if you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing youre sorely mistaken heres another cube
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_intro01|these bridges are made from natural light that i pump in from the surface if you rubbed your cheek on one it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face it would also set your hair on fire so dont actually do it
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_intro03|excellent youre a predator and these tests are your prey speaking of which i was researching sharks for an upcoming test do you know who else murders people who are only trying to help them
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_intro04|did you guess sharks because thats wrong the correct answer is nobody nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_the_gap01|good news i figured out what to do with all the money i save recycling your one roomful of air when you die im going to laminate your skeleton and pose you in the lobby that way future generations can learn from you how not to have your unfortunate bone structure
GLaDOS_sp_trust_fling_sphereinterrupt01|perfect the doors malfunctioning i guess somebodys going to have to repair that too no dont get up ill be right back dont touch anything
GLaDOS_sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_entrytwo01|i went and spoke with the door mainframe lets just say he wont be well living anymore anyway back to testing
GLaDOS_testchambermisc19|well done in fact you did so well im going to note this on your file in the commendations section oh theres lots of room here did well    enough
GLaDOS_turret_intro01|this next test involves turrets you remember them right theyre the pale spherical things that are full of bullets oh wait thats you in five seconds good luck
GLaDOS_testchambermisc21|to maintain a constant testing cycle i simulate daylight at all hours and add adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply so you may be confused about the passage of time the point is yesterday was your birthday i thought youd want to know
GLaDOS_testchambermisc23|you know how im going to live forever but youre going to be dead in sixty years  well ive been working on a belated birthday present for you well more of a belated birthday medical procedure well technically its a medical experiment whats important is its a present
GLaDOS_sp_a2_turret_intro01|that jumpsuit youre wearing looks stupid  thats not me talking its right here in your file on other people it looks fine but right here a scientist has noted that on you it looks stupid
GLaDOS_sp_a2_turret_intro03|well what does a neckbearded old engineer know about fashion he probably  oh wait its a she still what does she know  oh wait it says she has a medical degree in fashion from france
GLaDOS_testchambermisc30|im going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage i managed to find two with your last name a man and a woman so thats interesting its a small world
GLaDOS_sp_a2_turret_blocker_future_starter01|oops you trapped yourself i guess thats it then thanks for testing you may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position
GLaDOS_sp_a2_turret_blocker_future_starter02|im kidding not about you trapping yourself though that really happened here ill lower the glass go on finish the test
GLaDOS_testchambermisc31|i have a surprise waiting for you after this next test telling you would spoil the surprise so ill just give you a hint it involves meeting two people you havent seen in a long time
GLaDOS_testchambermisc39|it says this next test was designed by one of apertures nobel prize winners it doesnt say what the prize was for well i know it wasnt for being immune to neurotoxin
GLaDOS_testchambermisc33|ill bet you think i forgot about your surprise i didnt in fact were headed to your surprise right now after all these years im getting choked up just thinking about it
GLaDOS_testchambermisc34|initiating surprise in three two one
GLaDOS_testchambermisc35|i made it all up
GLaDOS_testchambermisc41|surprise
GLaDOS_sp_a2_column_blocker01|oh come on if it makes you feel any better they abandoned you at birth so i very seriously doubt theyd even want to see you
GLaDOS_sp_a2_column_blocker04|oh thats sad but impressive maybe they worked at the phone company
GLaDOS_sp_a2_column_blocker05|well you know the old formula comedy equals tragedy plus time and you have been asleep for a while so i guess its actually pretty funny when you do the math
GLaDOS_sp_a2_dilemma01|i thought about our dilemma and i came up with a solution that i honestly think works out best for one of both of us
GLaDOS_a2_triple_laser01|federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good
GLaDOS_a2_triple_laser02|thats right the facility is completely operational again
GLaDOS_a2_triple_laser03|i think these test chambers look even better than they did before it was easy really you just have to look at things objectively see what you dont need anymore and trim out the fat
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bts1_intro01|ive got a surprise for you after this next test not a fake tragic surprise like last time a real surprise with tragic consequences and real confetti this time the good stuff our last bag part of mes going to miss it i guessbut at the end of the day it was just taking up space
GLaDOS_jailbreak10|whats going on who turned off the lights
GLaDOS_jailbreak09|look  metal ball i can hear you
GLaDOS_jailbreakfaketest01|the irony is that you were almost at the last test
GLaDOS_jailbreakfaketest03|here it is why dont you just do it trust me its an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with
GLaDOS_jailbreakfaketest05|oh look theres a deer you probably cant see it get closer
GLaDOS_fgbrvtrap02|i honestly truly didnt think youd fall for that
GLaDOS_fgbrvtrap03|in fact i devised a much more elaborate trap further ahead for when you got through this easy one
GLaDOS_fgbrvtrap05|if id known youd let yourself get captured this easily i would have just dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling
GLaDOS_fgbturrets01|well it was nice catching up lets get to business
GLaDOS_fgb_trap01|i hope you brought something stronger than a portal gun this time
GLaDOS_fgb_trap02|otherwise im afraid youre about to become the immediate past president of the being alive club ha ha
GLaDOS_fgb_trap03|seriously though goodbye
GLaDOS_fgb_trap05|oh you were busy back there
GLaDOS_fgb_trap06|well i suppose we could just sit in this room and glare at each other until somebody drops dead but i have a better idea
GLaDOS_fgb_trap08|its your old friend deadly neurotoxin if i were you id take a deep breath and hold it
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_pre09|i hate you so much
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer04|thats funny i dont feel corrupt in fact i feel pretty good
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer05|core transfer
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer06|oh you are kidding me
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core02|do not plug that little idiot into my mainframe
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core01|dont you dare plug him in
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer13|dont do it
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core03|dont plug him in
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core04|dont plug him in
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer07|no
